This repository is for showing some code that I wrote for my group project SSHades.
This project was made using Microsoft XNA 4.0, together with 3 other people (two artists,
who were responsible for the 3D art, etc., and one other programmer who was responsible
for the coding of the player.)

To know a bit more about me, or about this project and the people who helped create this game,
